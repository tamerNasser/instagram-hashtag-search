# Welcome to our site src :

## This was my project for the founders & coders week 2 of the boot camp - Done with @majdya

### Once you are in the site you can find the weather on the top left, time and date at the top right, and a contact us button at the top mid that will take you for the team who built the site.

### Then you will find a *search* bar where you can search for images in Instegram by #hashTag and get the most popular/recent images.  
# Required:
### You wil need to add new file called config.js at the "gihub" folder, then add two variable(with correct values) you can check what variables you need to define at the top of the github js file.
### Enjoy.
